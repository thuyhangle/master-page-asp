    <h2>Animals in House</h2>
    <p>Several types of animals can live in your house. In all cases, the primary principle for 
        getting rid of animals in your house is to identify the entry holes they are using to get inside,
        and then installing traps on exclusion doors on those holes. After all the animals are trapped and removed or excluded, 
        the entry holes must be sealed shut. In the case of rats and mice, the entry holes should be sealed first.</p>

    <h2>Wild Animals</h2>
    <p>Wild animals can be a nuisance to your home, your yard or your health in different ways. 
        For example, rodents can dig holes in your yard, chew their way into your house and reproduce like crazy which 
        can be a really big headache to you. Other animals, like armadillos and foxes, can actually ruin the foundation of 
        your home by digging their dens under your house. Some wild animals, like mice, venomous snakes, rabid bats or feral dogs 
        can be dangerous and should be dealt with immediately by you or by a professional. </p>
